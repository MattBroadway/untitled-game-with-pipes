# Meeting 2 #
- a blow button (wind not always blowing)
- decided on straws instead of pipes
- decided that the child will not be blowing on each top tile
	- the top row will be part of the level file
	- the top row will be locked
- need a blank tile
- need a locked tile graphic (Gray scale of original tile)
- change level format
	- either make tiles object and add new attributes
	- add "locked" attribute which stores positions of locked tiles
- initialise with factory methods
	- create a LevelFile class which initialises the logical objects from a JSON file

- how about different children (or the same one) growing up as more candles are added (the age of the person blowing gives a visual representation of the players progress)
